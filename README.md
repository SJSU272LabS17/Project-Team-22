Abstract – ML Enabled Food Journal

Application leverages image classification to identify foods and log nutritional info into user’s journal. Simplifies calorie counting and provides a dataset to run analytics. Future improvements include pulling in health and activity data from wearables and smart scales. Predictive analytics could then be use to estimate weight loss and health based on real-time nutrition and fitness data. Application would leverage the cloud to score images using pre-trained DNNs, and store user’s data. A smartphone based front end applcation would be required.
